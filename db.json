Master not just of the House in which I work, but of the entirety of the domain beneath the earth, the place we all end up after we die. He is a god of character, I have to give him that. In life, I once served someone who reminded me of him a little, yet even the kingliest of mortals pales in comparison. Suffice it, then, to say that the Lord Hades takes matters of the Underworld in utmost seriousness. He is impatient with his only son. Impatient to make progress at his never-ending work, for he presides over an endless procession of the dead. The Master claims that he alone can tend to their affairs, but not-so-secretly, I think, desires that his son assisted him. The Master may be dedicated to his work, but has no love for it, nor does he harbor any love for his own family upon Olympus, whom I think he blames for every aspect of his misery. Perhaps you think that he is undeserving of one's sympathies; but, he has some of mine, and I am grateful to him, that he chose me, and released me from an aimless death, and into his employ."

Though Hypnos may be lacking in propriety, he brings a certain cheer, however unconventional, into the grim proceedings of the House. It is a wonder that the Master is so tolerant of this.

As death is swift and unavoidable to mortals, so is Thanatos devoted without question to his work. Fatherless, he honors always his mother, the goddess Nyx. He tirelessly serves his foreign Master, whose son at least he adores, despite their opposing manner and outlook. Thanatos would never speak of this, but it is clear, to me.

I do, however, know what she herself has volunteered to me, as we have on occasion passed the off-work time together in the Master's lounge.

Yet, there is something more to Hermes: He is the only god upon Olympus who dutifully serves the Underworld, in addition to his Olympian affairs. The Underworld is an orderly place, but the souls of the dead must first be brought to its brink. He has much to do with this.

Once, she administered her gifts of sustenance with generosity, until some stroke of Fate befell. She changed, and never been as giving since. The mortals who once prayed to her for plenty now beg mostly for mercy. My understanding is, despite popular belief, Demeter is no direct relation to Lord Hades or his brothers, being born of more ancient Titan stock; she certainly has taken pains to distance herself from Zeus in particular, often leaving Olympus for long stretches, in search of something. Or someone. Not that I would know a thing of it; only the mutterings of shades descended to this realm from freezing cold or famine. Surely, they pray, the seasons are due for a turn for the better?"

      "description": "...The fearsome multi-headed hound of hell is really not so bad as his deserved reputation otherwise would lead you to believe. Yes, the massive beast has feasted on no short supply of interlopers to the Underworld, or on those attempting to escape. However, tales of the number of his heads are oft exaggerated, and in his old age, his temperament has grown much more relaxed. Indeed, he seems one of the sole sources of comfort for the House's grim Master. The fact that Cerberus now frequently rests at his Master's side also suggests the Underworld has new vulnerabilities, a source of some concern to the Lord Hades, who understandably takes pride in his domain's imposing reputation."

      "description": "...A splendid House such as the Master's own requires a great deal of cleaning, and the little gorgon seems forever doomed to do it all herself. I sometimes offer my assistance, although it is here the little gorgon bares her fangs, refusing any help. That I can clearly see my own reflection in our polished countertops suggests she doesn't need it, either. Although she comes off as talkative, to my knowledge she has never been forthcoming about the circumstances that led her here. A background check confirmed she has only trace connections to the gorgons of Asphodel, though could not verify any connection to the notorious gorgon-sisters of the surface. The Master deemed further inquiry into this unlawful, and granted supervisory responsibilities to Nyx, who ensures the gorgon's workload is always full. In turn, the gorgon steadfastly accomplishes her duties, with diligence if not grace, perhaps finding pleasure purely in a job well done."

      "description": "...The animated skeleton and I, we seldom get along. He is too talkative for me, and spouts such simple condescensions to all those in earshot, seemingly as though he were an expert in the ways of war. I disapprove of his reckless advice, and am uncertain as to who he was in life, to be so self-assured in death. I am uncertain as to why he is even here; it is quite odd the Master does not know of him, at all. Nevertheless, I sense that there is naught to fear from him. And, I have to confess, I admire the determination with which he carries out his task, of simply standing at attention, being beaten, often mercilessly, all for martial training's sake. My limited inquiries as to his origins have come up empty as of yet. I know only that he first appeared in the House's upper courtyard soon after the Master and his son had their latest, terrible exchange of words. To think, at first I thought the Master set this skeleton to work. But, if not the Master... who?"
